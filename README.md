# HikeShare - The app that allows you to view map imagery and track your hikes
- Users can view map data from sources like USGS National Map (SAT/TOPO), Mapnik, OpenTopoMap, and more. Pressing the play button at the bottom of the screen starts tracking the users hike and will trace the path of the hike on the screen while also saving to a local KML file.
- Users can also view KML data through a variety of map sources, the KML can be locally created files generated by the app or files imported on to the device.
- Users can browse the tile cache on their device to see precisely how many map tiles are being stored, what source they come from, and when they expire. Users also have the ability to download new regions for offline use.

# Hike Activity 
- This is where users can switch between map sources and view general map data or track their own hikes. Users also can drop pins on the map (there are a variety of pins for different activities) and these will be saved to a KML file.

# MapTileManager Activity

The user also can select specific regions that they want to download or specify a path of tiles that they want to download (currently not functioning). For the true map geek you can even view the information on individual map tiles!
